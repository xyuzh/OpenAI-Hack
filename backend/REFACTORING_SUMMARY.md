# Backend Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The backend has been refactored to simplify the architecture by:
1. Removing Daytona and E2B sandbox services
2. Simplifying environment variables to only OPENAI_API_KEY and COMPOSIO_API_KEY
3. Configuring the system to only use OpenAI models (with support for GPT-5 when available)

## Key Changes

### 1. Environment Variables Simplified
- **Before**: Multiple environment variables for various services
- **After**: Only two required environment variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For OpenAI API access
  - `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`: For Composio integration

### 2. Sandbox Services Removed
- Deleted `workflow/service/daytona_sandbox.py`
- Deleted `workflow/service/e2b_sandbox.py`
- Removed all references to Daytona initialization in `runner.py`
- Cleaned up `tool/context.py` to remove sandbox properties
- Updated `job_plan/executor.py` to remove sandbox dependencies

### 3. OpenAI-Only LLM Configuration
- **Simplified LLMConfig class** (`workflow/core/config/llm_config.py`):
  - Removed AWS, Azure, Ollama, OpenRouter configurations
  - Focused solely on OpenAI parameters
  - Default model set to `gpt-4o`
  - Support for future `gpt-5` model

- **Updated Model Enum** (`workflow/llm/llm.py`):
  - Only includes OpenAI models: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
  - Prepared for GPT-5 (commented out until available)

- **Cleaned up model lists**:
  - Function calling models: Only OpenAI models
  - Reasoning effort models: Only o1 family
  - Cache prompt models: Removed (OpenAI doesn't use this feature)

### 4. Configuration Updates
- **AppConfig** (`workflow/core/config/app_config.py`):
  - Added `openai_api_key` and `composio_api_key` fields
  - Removed Daytona/E2B related fields
  - Removed Modal API token fields
  - Auto-loads OpenAI API key into default LLM config

- **Config Loading** (`workflow/core/config/utils.py`):
  - Simplified to handle only essential API keys
  - Automatic injection of API keys into configurations

### 5. Dependencies Cleaned
- **pyproject.toml**:
  - Commented out `daytona`, `daytona-sdk`, and `e2b` dependencies
  - Kept `litellm` as it provides the OpenAI interface
  - Updated poetry.lock accordingly

### 6. Files Created
- `.env`: Contains actual API keys (not to be committed)
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables
- `config.toml.example`: Example configuration file for OpenAI settings

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys
2. Copy `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` if you need custom settings
3. Run `poetry install` to update dependencies

### API Keys Required
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **COMPOSIO_API_KEY**: Get from Composio dashboard

### Supported OpenAI Models
- `gpt-4o` (default) - Latest multimodal model
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Smaller, faster variant
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Turbo variant of GPT-4
- `gpt-4` - Standard GPT-4
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Fast, cost-effective model
- `gpt-5` - Ready for future model (when released)

## Testing
The thread-based API endpoints remain unchanged:
- `/api/agent/initiate` - Create new thread
- `/api/agent/{thread_id}/execute` - Execute task in thread
- `/api/agent/{thread_id}/stream` - Stream results via SSE

Run tests with: `poetry run python test_thread_api.py`

## Notes
- LiteLLM is retained as it provides a clean interface to OpenAI
- The system is now significantly simpler with fewer external dependencies
- All non-OpenAI model references have been removed
- Ready for GPT-5 when it becomes available
